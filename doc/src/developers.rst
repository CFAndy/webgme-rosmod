Deploying ROSMOD
================

This page acts as a launchpad for diving into the different aspects of
the code, the interfaces provided by each submodule, and learning how
everything works behind the scenes.  It covers everything from how to
create meta-models, how to create domain-specific interfaces and
plugins based on those meta-models and provides some guide-lines for
such interfaces.
