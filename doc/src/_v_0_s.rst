Deployments
===========

Deployments are an abstract grouping of **Instances** of ``Components``
into processes (which are called, using ROS terminology, ``Nodes``), and
further grouping processes into ``Containers``, which are an abstract
definition of ``Hosts``. The actual mapping from ``Containers`` to
``Hosts`` actually happens automatically in an ``Experiment``.
