ROSMOD GUI and Tool-Suite
=========================

.. ROSMOD GUI contains the relevant code for the user interface and
   plugins related to ROSMOD.  ROSMOD GUI enables the creation of
   models of software, systems, deployments, and experiments.  It also
   contains plugins which allow the generation and compilation of code
   from the software model, as well as plugins that enable the
   deployment of the compiled code onto the systems specified in the
   model.

   The documentation has been broken down into varoius sections by
   relevance.  The starting point is the :ref:`getting-started` page
   which provides an overview of the parts of the project, and should
