# ROSMOD-GUI

This repository contains the implementation of ROSMOD-GUI, based on
[WebGME](http://github.com/webgme/webgme), a live demo of which can be
found on [WebGME.org](http://webgme.org).

An example server running ROSMOD-GUI can be found on
[rosmod.rcps.isis.vanderbilt.edu](http://rosmod.rcps.isis.vanderbilt.edu).  RCPS is
a BeagleBone Black cluster at the Vanderbilt University Institute for
Software Integrated Systems (ISIS), on which we run resilient,
distributed CPS research.  Please note that guest accounts are not
allowed to run any processes on the cluster (such as compilation or
experiment deployments), but are allowed to create models and
download the generated artifacts from those models (such as code
source and deployment files).

Documentation for ROSMOD-GUI can be found here:
